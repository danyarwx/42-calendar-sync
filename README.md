# 📅 Mallett Calendar Sync  
>**Never Miss a 42 Event Ever Again**

A lightweight integration that automatically syncs your **42 Intra events** with **Google Calendar**, so you never have to manually copy event times again.  
Built for the 42 Heilbronn community — by students, for students.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Students at 42 manage dozens of events each week — rushes, exams, workshops, and evaluations — all listed on the Intra platform.  
This tool connects **42 Intra** with **Google Calendar**, allowing one-click subscription and real-time synchronization of events.  

It starts as a **browser extension + Node.js backend** MVP and can evolve into a full-fledged web app.
